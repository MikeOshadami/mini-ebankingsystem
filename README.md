# mini- ebankingsystem
Mini Ebanking System School Project

This project focuses on the development and implementation of a web based banking system in Nigeria. It would provide customers with easy access to perform and implement various banking operations such as transfer of funds in Nigeria and transfer of funds outside Nigeria, pay bills or vouchers, check account balance, change or create pin etc.
 
 However the proposed system will not be able to perform transactions outside Nigeria.
